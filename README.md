Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard using Power BI

The "Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard" project involved leveraging Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes credit card transaction data. This project provided insights into customer spending patterns, transaction volumes, and key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard enabled users to explore trends, identify anomalies, and make data-driven decisions to optimize customer engagement and financial operations.
